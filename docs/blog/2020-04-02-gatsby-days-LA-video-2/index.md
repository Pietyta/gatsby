_Welcome to the Gatsby Days 2020 Video Blog: Los Angeles Edition. In this series of eleven videos, you can catch up with all the presentations from our February community gathering in LA. If you weren’t able to make it in person, these videos are the next best thing to owning a time machine! (Though owning a time machine would be super cool, joining us at our next Gatsby Days—currently scheduled for October 19th in Amsterdam—would also be pretty awesome)._

Dustin Shau, Gatsby's Head of Product, is a dedicated open source developer. He was first drawn to the framework by Gatsby’s exceptional performance and outstanding developer experience. Now a Gatsby team member, Dustin is focused on making Gatsby the fastest, most inclusive platform for building websites and web applications.

Watch Dustin demonstrate the impressive build-time performance of Gatsby and Gatsby Cloud by walking through typical developer workflows, including updating a website using Contentful's headless CMS and then rapidly deploying the results through a content delivery network (CDN). And discover how Gatsby enables developers to quickly incorporate accessibility capabilities—such as a SkipNav function—to deliver inclusive web experiences to the widest possible audience.
